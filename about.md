I am a research engineer in Meta AI, working on applying AI (and especially transformers) to problems of mathematics.
This blog documents miscellaneous experiments, too small to fit on a paper, but interesting nevertheless. 

### Publications
* [Deep learning for symbolic mathematics (2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01412), with Guillaume Lample: transformers can learn to integrate functions, and solve first and second order ordinary differential equations
* [Learning advanced mathematical computations from examples (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.06462), with Amaury Hayat and Guillaume Lample: learning proposerties of differential systems, convergence at a critical point (aka the Spectral Mapping Theorem), controllability of overparametrized systems, integrability of some partial differential equations. 
* [A deep language model to predict metabolic network equilibria (2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03588), with Amaury Hayat, Sean McQuade, Nathaniel Merrill and Benedetto Piccoli: predicting properties of transport graphs, existence of an equilibrium, and flows at the equilibrium.
* [Linear algebra with transformers (2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.01898): learning basic operations on matrices (transposition, addition, multiplication), eigenvalue and singular value decomposition and matrix inversion. Results on out-of-distribution generalization.
